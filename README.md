# About
This project was created with the goal of providing a generalized compute plane on Kubernetes for Data Engineering teams. The tools used in this project are open source, and can be modified for other use cases.

You might find this project useful if:
1. You are building a GKE cluster with Terraform and need a reference on how to set up ingress, domains, kubernetes manifests, IAP, and helm releases in a single repo.
2. You are looking for a reference on how to bootstrap ArgoCD to a cluster.
3. You are trying to bootstrap your local `kind` k8s cluster with Kubernetes manifests/Helm charts and need a reference.
